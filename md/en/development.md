## Development Model

> [!NOTE]
> Design efficient development processes and solutions based on project requirements and timelines to ensure effective problem resolution.

---

### Individual Development

> [!NOTE]
> Focus on functional implementation and system integration, handling everything from requirement analysis to code implementation to address personal technical needs.

- #### Development Process
  - Identify everyday problems and brainstorm ways to solve them with programming.
  - Adopt a "self-sufficient" approach to development, acting as both the client and the developer to analyze needs and devise solutions.
  - Development steps:
    1. Establish **front-end UI structure** to visualize the general layout.
    2. Design **back-end data structures** to ensure logical clarity.
    3. Link front-end and back-end to enable functional interactions.
  - Preferred area: Back-end logic design, focusing on efficient transformation between input and output.
- #### UI Design
  - Keep the interface clean and straightforward, with intuitive and functional design that avoids unnecessary extravagance.
  - Often collaborates with the client (or self) to discuss page requirements and content before designing the UI.
- #### AI Collaboration
  - Draft an initial version of the code and invite AI to optimize it and assist in debugging logic errors.
  - When issues arise, ask AI to analyze errors and propose solutions.

### Team Development

> [!NOTE]
> When project scope expands or timelines tighten, leverage team collaboration to boost development efficiency and ensure on-time delivery.

- #### Roles and Responsibilities
  - Serve as a **full-stack developer**, proficient in scripting (Python) and full-stack development (Next.js).
  - Prefer focusing on scripting and back-end logic while also possessing full-stack development capabilities.
- #### Project Management
  - Hold regular meetings to set short-term goals and monitor team progress.
  - Use **Trello** to manage project schedules, breaking down tasks into smaller cards for clear objectives and responsibilities.
- #### Prioritization
  - When faced with large-scale requirements and tight deadlines, list core functionalities and prioritize their completion before addressing additional features.
- #### Design Requirements
  - Clients provide initial requirements and ideas, which are refined into actionable development tasks and logged as Trello cards.
  - Primarily responsible for designing UI/UX, but open to collaborating with professional designers to enhance aesthetics and user experience.
- #### Multi-Platform Development
  - Focus on **Web Development**, prioritizing browser-based platforms to minimize dependency on iOS/Android environments.
